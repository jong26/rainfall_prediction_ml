# rainfall_prediction_ml
This project used various machine learning algorithms to predict rainfall.
It used different  machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM.

Model Evaluation has been done using: Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R2-Score.

The data was taken from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.
